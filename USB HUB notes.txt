4.0 USB Signals--Note:
1.Can switch +/- D pairs over i2c registers
2.Usb3.0 has automatic polarity detection

12.1 USB 3.0 SuperSpeed design guidelines 
-"The polarity can be swapped on the USB 3.0 differential pairs. Polarity detection is done automatically by
the USB 3.0 PHY during link training, as defined in the USB3.0 specification section 6.4.2, and does not
require any additional changes to device firmware. Given the different USB connectors pinouts, the polarity
inversion mechanism can be used to ensure that USB traces do not cross each other." 

USB3 specification 6.4.2
- "the Receiver shall use the D10.2 Symbol within the TSEQ
Ordered Set to determine lane polarity inversion"

INFINEON-AN70707 12.1
-"AC coupling capacitors should have a cut-out in the shape of these capacitors on the immediate solid GND
layer to reduce reflection on the super speed signals."... confirm this somewhere else... is this a cut out of the GND layer underneath? just the pad... or entire capacitor size?

Hardware Design checklist 9.4 Self Powered/Bus Powered settings
Self-Powered vs Bus-Powered:
	-Design currently uses barrel jack to power 5744 IC - self-powered
	-If 5744 is powered through a usb connector - bus-powered
From https://www.edn.com/usb-3-1-implementation-of-usb-type-c/:
USB-C can "eliminate power barrel jack connector from new platforms."



USB 2.0 D+ D- on type-C receptacle can be shorted together (will create a stub).
From Texas Instruments A Primer on USB Type-C® and USB
Power Delivery Applications and
Requirements - "Although it’s not required, some designers elect to
include a USB 2.0 mux in their system to improve signal
integrity."

Finding required track width and spacing with JLC3313 stack up

JLC3313 stack up:

Top Layer1 		Copper 	0.035 mm 	
Prepreg 		3313*1 	0.0994 mm	epsilonr = 4.05
Inner Layer2 	Copper 	0.0152 mm
Core 			FR4 		1.265 mm	epsilonr = 4.6
Inner Layer3 	Copper 	0.0152 mm
Prepreg 		3313*1 	0.0994 mm 	epsilonr = 4.05
Bottom Layer4 	Copper 	0.035 mm

KiCad calculator results (JLC calculator is confusing). 3/14/23
	Transmission Line type: 
		Coupled microstip line
	
	Substrate parameters:
		epsilonr = 4.05	(dielectric constant)
		tan(δ) = 0.02	* (also knows as loss cofactor or loss tangent)
		ρ = 1.72e-08	(electric resistivity for copper)
		H = 0.0994mm	(height of dielectric beneath signal)
		H_t = 1e+20		(height between signal and ground plane above; using 1000mm to represent infinity because our signals are routed on the top layer)
		T = 0.035		(copper thiccness)
		roughness = 0	(roughness of surface not necessary)
		μ = 1			(relative permiability of conductor not neccessary)

	Physical parameters:
		W = 0.175mm (width)
		S = 0.09mm (Spacing) -->minumum for JLCPCB
	
	Results:
		Differential Impedance = 90ohms	--> 90 ohms required to match USB's cable impedance


*Could not find on JLCPCB's website
*Google: The Tan δ of most PCB materials ranges from 0.02 for most commonly used materials to 0.001 for very low-loss high-end materials -->https://www.protoexpress.com/blog/pcb-substrates-knowing-dielectric-materials-properties/


4 Copper layers:

Picking stackup that keeps GND closest to signal routing layer with differential pairs to create the shortest distance for E-Field to travel-->Helps signal integrity

Minumun trace width and spacing = 0.09mm (4-6 Layer boards):

Power switching regulator (MIC2099-1YMT-TR):
Using DC barrel jack so USB5744 is "self-powered"
Switched on from port control (USB5744) -->Enable pin (MIC2099-1YMT-TR), then downstream ports are powered through barrel jack
current limit resistor from Ilimit pin--> GND, sets current limit at Vout. Detailed in "Setting Ilimit" section of data sheet --> https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/268/mic2095-1076850.pdf
Table 2-->200ohm limiting resistor, limits output current to ~1A

Downstream USB ports on right edge of board currently... probably makes more sense to move them to bottom edge of the board to line up with IC pins

To do:

Find what vbus voltage divider... eval board uses 100k 100k.
